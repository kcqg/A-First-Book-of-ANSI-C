This Repo will be for saving sample programs 
and my answers to most of its programming exercises,
i.e. from the book "A First Book of ANSI C (4th edition) by Gary Bronson"
https://www.amazon.com/First-Book-Fourth-Introduction-Programming/dp/1418835560

All the source code are done using the Virtual-C IDE, it's a simple IDE for learning and teaching the C programming language. https://sites.google.com/site/virtualcide/
